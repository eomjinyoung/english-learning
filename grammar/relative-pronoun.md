```

형용사절

절과 구의 차이점
> - I commute). (절 - 주어와 동사가 존재)
> - commuting from my house to work during the traffic jam. (구 - 주어와 동사가 없다.)

be 동사가 있는 절을 구로 바꾸는 경우,
> - **Han** was my teacher. **Han** is teaching English.
>   - *Han* was my teacher. `Who` is teaching English.
>   - *Han* `who is teaching English `was my teacher.
>   - *Han* ~~who is~~ `teaching English` was my teacher.
>     - who가 Han을 가리킨다. 즉 관계대명사가 의미상 반복되는 단어라서 뺀다.
>     - be 동사는 빼도 의미에 큰 영향을 주지 않는다.
> - **The book** `that was nominated as a book of 2010` the best seller.
>   - *The book* ~~that was~~ `nominated as a book of 2010` the best seller.

일반 동사가 있는 절을 구로 바꾸는 경우,
> - **Han** `who teaches English` was my teacher.
>   - *Han* ~~who teaches~~ `teaching English` was my teacher. 
>     - 주어를 뺀다.
>     - 일반 동사에 ing를 붙여 동사가 되지 않게 한다.
> - He was **a volunteer** `who helped us` during the summer.
>   - He was *a volunteer* ~~who helped~~ `helping us` during the summer.

형용사절에서 관계대명사가 **목적격**인 경우 절을 구로 바꿀 수 없다.
> - I Happened to see **Jason** `who you liked`.
>   - I Happened to see *Jason* ~~who~~ 'you liked`.
>     - 형용사절에서 의미상 같은 관계대명사 목적격은 생략할 수 있다.
>     - 그러나 주어와 동사를 생략 불가하다! 
> - **The man** `who I am working with` is easy going. 
>   - *The man* ~~who~~ `I am working with` is easy going. 
> - I like **everything** `that you told me`.
>   - I like *everything* ~~that~~ `you told me`.
